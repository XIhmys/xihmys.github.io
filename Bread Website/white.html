   <h2>White</h2> 
   <p>White is a staple in many cultures, beloved for its soft texture and mild flavor. It's typically made from wheat flour that has been highly refined, meaning the bran and germ have been removed, leaving behind mainly the starchy endosperm. This refining process gives white its characteristic light color and fluffy texture.

White is commonly leavened with yeast, which helps the dough rise, giving the its airy structure. Other ingredients often include water, salt, and sometimes sugar or fat, which can enhance the flavor and texture.

In terms of taste, white tends to be neutral and slightly sweet, making it versatile for pairing with a variety of toppings, from savory deli meats and cheeses to sweet spreads like jam or honey. It's often used to make sandwiches, toast, or as a side to dishes like soups and salads.

While white is a popular choice for its softness and familiarity, some people opt for whole grain or whole wheat for its higher fiber and nutrient content, as white lacks the fiber, vitamins, and minerals found in the bran and germ of whole grains. </p>

		<h2>Ingredients and Instructions</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>4 cups (500g) all-purpose flour</li>
			<li>2 teaspoons (7g) active dry yeast </li>
			<li>1 1/2 teaspoons (8g) salt </li>
			<li>1 tablespoon (12g) granulated sugar</li>
			<li>1 1/4 cups (300ml) warm water (about 110째F or 45째C) </li>
			<li>2 tablespoons (28g) unsalted butter, softened (optional, for added richness) </li>
			</ul>
			<p>Instructions: </p>
			<ul>

<li>Poof the yeast: In a small bowl, dissolve the sugar in the warm water. Sprinkle the yeast over the water and let it sit for about 5-10 minutes, until it becomes frothy. </li> 

<li>Mix the dry ingredients: In a large mixing bowl, combine the flour and salt. If you're using butter, you can add it at this stage as well. </li>

<li>Combine wet and dry ingredients: Make a well in the center of the flour mixture and pour in the yeast mixture. Stir until a rough dough forms. </li>

<li>Knead the dough: Turn the dough out onto a floured surface and knead for about 8-10 minutes, until the dough is smooth and elastic. You can also use a stand mixer with a dough hook attachment for this step. </li>

<li>First rise: Place the dough in a greased bowl, turning once to coat the dough with oil. Cover the bowl with a clean kitchen towel or plastic wrap and let it rise in a warm, draft-free place for about 1-1.5 hours, or until doubled in size. </li>

<li>Shape the dough: Punch down the risen dough to release the air bubbles. Turn it out onto a lightly floured surface and shape it into a loaf. You can either shape it into a classic loaf shape or use a loaf pan for a more uniform shape. </li>

<li>Second rise: Place the shaped dough into a greased loaf pan (if using) or onto a parchment-lined baking sheet. Cover it loosely with a clean kitchen towel or plastic wrap and let it rise for another 30-45 minutes, or until it has risen about 1 inch above the rim of the pan. </li>

				<li>Preheat the oven: While the dough is rising, preheat your oven to 375째F (190째C). </li>

<li>Bake the: Once the dough has finished rising, remove the towel or plastic wrap and place the loaf in the preheated oven. Bake for 30-35 minutes, or until the is golden brown and sounds hollow when tapped on the bottom. </li>

<li>Cool and enjoy: Remove the from the oven and let it cool in the pan for a few minutes before transferring it to a wire rack to cool completely. Slice and enjoy your homemade white! </li>
			</ul>

<p>Feel free to adjust the ingredients or add different flavors like herbs or seeds to customize your white to your taste preferences. </p>
